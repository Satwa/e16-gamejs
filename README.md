## Introduction

This week, we had to make a game in Vanilla JS. Our choices led us to a Bomberman-like with multiplayer.

To do that, from 15/04/19 to 19/04/19, after discovering the topic, we assigned tasks to everybody in order to be more efficient. Of course, most of the things are in English except while browsing the website.

#### Our crew at E16
- Valentin Séjourné *at Development & Design*
- Arnaud Soyer *at Marketing & Communication*
- Céline Sung *at Marketing, Communication & Design*
- Joshua Tabakhoff *at Development*
- Naomi Talla *at Design & Game Design*

## Build the project

The whole project needs to be compiled using Gulp. To do that:

- Install Gulp on your system
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```gulp watch``` and go *localhost:5001*


If you want to play in multiplayer: 
- Run ```npm start``` from *./*
- Change the socket url in client in *src/scripts/app.js* around *line 33*
